Straighten out your Backbone.js

Usage
-----

For the time being we are not bundling all of the dependencies for this module
into the `chiropractor.js` file, instead you will need to define those
dependencies yourself. You can reference the `bower.json` file to get a list
of all of the dependencies (both development and production) or reference
`build.js` to see what the bare minimum requirejs configuration file looks like
to support this module.

```
require.config({
    paths: {
        'chiropractor':       'bower_components/chiropractor/chiropractor',
        'handlebars':         'bower_components/require-handlebars-plugin/Handlebars',
        'hbs':                'bower_components/require-handlebars-plugin/hbs',
        'i18nprecompile':     'bower_components/require-handlebars-plugin/hbs/i18nprecompile',
        'json2':              'bower_components/require-handlebars-plugin/hbs/json2',
        'underscore':         'bower_components/underscore/underscore',
        'jquery':             'bower_components/jquery/jquery',
        'jquery.cookie':      'bower_components/jquery.cookie/jquery.cookie'
    },

    hbs: {
        disableI18n: true,
        disableHelpers: true
    },

    pragmasOnSave: {
        excludeHbsParser : true,
        excludeHbs: true,
        excludeAfterBuild: true
    },

    shim: {
        'underscore': {
            exports: '_'
        },
        'jquery.cookie': {
            deps: ['jquery'],
            exports: 'jQuery.cookie'
        }
    }
});
```

Building
--------

To get started developing Chiropractor you must first run two commands to
install all of the dependencies:

    npm install
    bower install

In order to compile the Chiropractor code for release you must run:

    grunt

Which will generate `chiropractor.js` as well as `chiropractor.min.js` in the
root of the project. Whenever you wish to run this command, please be sure to
increment the version defined in `package.json` as well as `bower.json`.

Tests
-----

There are two ways to run tests:

    npm test

Or if you want more control over how your tests are run (such as continuous
testing with auto-running tests on file changes you can run:

    ./node_modules/.bin/karma start --dev --browsers Chrome,PhantomJS

Previewing
-----

You can preview example functionality of Chiropractor by first running:

    grunt devserver


goto: http://localhost:8888

Also you check out the /example folder for the source code of these examples
in how to integrate Chiropractor into your project.

Enabling ErrorHandling
-----

You can enable Chiropractor default error handler for api unreachable or error
codes by setting the property: enableErrorHandler: true in your model or collection.

You can also override or create your own custom error template by overriding the row "error" template with your own.
